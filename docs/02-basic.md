# (PART\*) Getting started {.unnumbered}

# Introduction {#basic-intro .unnumbered}

The goal of the next four chapters is to get you writing Shiny apps as quickly as possible.
In Chapter \@ref(basic-app), I'll start small, but complete, showing you all the major pieces of an app and how they fit together.
Then in Chapters \@ref(basic-ui) and \@ref(basic-reactivity) you'll start to get into the details of the two major parts of a Shiny app: the frontend (what the user sees in the browser) and the backend (the code that makes it all work).
We'll finish up in Chapter \@ref(basic-case-study) with a case study to help cement the concepts you've learned so far.
